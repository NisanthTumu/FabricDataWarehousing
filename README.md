**End to End Data Factory Project**

The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable, cloud-based data analytics using Microsoft Fabric services. It involves from data loading using Copy Into command and CTAS, stored procedures, big data analytics, dimensional data modelling with star schema of facts and dimensions, to CTEs, subqueries, the Visual Query Editor, covering real world applications and Power BI report.
